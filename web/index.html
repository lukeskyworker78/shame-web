<p>This web is dedicated to expose the shameful policy of CELLS Management towards 
its workers and their representatives.</p>
<p>CELLS as an institution and its head of Finance and HHRR as an individual, are 
both suing 5 ALBA workers' representatives in relation to their decision of 
canceling an assembly in which the head of HHRR was present and refused to 
leave. Note that said assembly was called for discussing the worker's position 
in front of a regulation that had been drafted and negotiated in name of CELLS 
by the head of HHRR herself.</p>
<p>The Management pretends to present this as "supporting a worker who is being 
discriminated by the Workers' Committee" when in reality, the decision of 
canceling the meeting was taken by request of other workers who rightly felt 
that they would not be able to express freely if the counter-part in the 
negotiations was present in the assembly.</p>
<p>It is also worth noting that CELLS Management has been informed several times 
in the past of violations of workers' rights. In those occasions they either 
did nothing, or sided with the abuser (who typically was part of Management or 
close to it). </p>
<p>In contrast, CELLS is now wasting ALBA's (public) money to sue us and even 
demand us to pay 6251 €. Therefore, we can only interpret the current case 
as an excuse to punish us and intimidate the rest of ALBA workers. Of course, 
we have to pay for our lawyer with our own money which is already a form of 
punishment independently of the result of the trial.</p>
<p>But where they have got money and company lawyers, we have union and mutual 
support. Please <strong>consider showing your support to your colleagues by printing 
and posting in visible places one of the <a href="./posters/">posters</a></strong>. 
Also feel free to share this page with any friends or colleagues at other 
institutions.</p>
<p><strong>Because we are proud to work at ALBA, but ashamed of working for CELLS</strong></p>
